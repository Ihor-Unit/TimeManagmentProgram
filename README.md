# About TimeManagmentProgram
This program helps you to track the time spent when sitting in front of your computer. This program is extremely simple and can't do much.
## How to set things up?
Download the project and compile the files in [MS Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com). If you use different IDE I can't enshure you that it'll compile properly because of using VS workload dlls.
**But if you are good with the compilation:**
 - Choose a folder where you want the program to store and create files with the data
 - Create a shortcut to the `.exe` file 
 - Press Win + R and write `shell:startup`
 - Move the shortcut to the startup folder and run the shortcut or restart your pc.
